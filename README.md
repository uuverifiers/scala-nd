# Scala-ND

Scala-ND is a simple Scala library for expressing non-deterministic computations. The library is mainly intended for teaching purposes, and includes a version of the Travelling Salesperson problem (TSP) and the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT).

To use Scala-ND, you only need to have a JVM and the Scala build tool SBT installed. The examples can then be run with the command "sbt run".
